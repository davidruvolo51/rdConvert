Description: As R6 class for converting Rd files to markdown with YAML headers. This may be useful if you wish to use package documentation in static site generators outside of the R ecosystem (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, Gatsby, etc.). By default, Rd files are rendered into their own directory with an independent `index.md` file. The Rd name is parsed and set as the child directory name.
