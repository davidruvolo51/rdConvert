# Introduction

**rdConvert** is an R package for creating a package documentation site using [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) or your preferred web framework. Included in this package, is a workflow for converting Rd files to markdown using the code documentation started developed by [RocketSeat](https://github.com/rocketseat/gatsby-themes). This theme gives you the essential tools for generating a Gatsby site.

## Motiviation

My motiviation for this project was to figure out how to integrated R package files with other web frameworks. I use React and Gatsby for other proejcts and I wanted to see if it was possible to create a Gatsby site from R man files. The idea behind this workflow is:

> If you want a well-documented nice looking site, then you must document it in your R files!

This workflow could not be possible without the [Rd2md](https://github.com/quantsch/Rd2md), [Rd2roxygen](https://github.com/yihui/Rd2roxygen), and [roxygen2md](https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2md) packages. Alternatively, you can opt out of Gatsby steps and use it as Rd to Md converter.

If you have questions, feel free to open a new issue on [rdConvert GitHub repository](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/rdConvert). Take a look at the code and files to see how the project should be structured.
