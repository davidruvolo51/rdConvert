# Introduction

**rdConvert** is an R package for creating a package documentation site using your preferred web framework. The idea is that if you want a nice looking site, then you must document it. Included in this package, is a workflow for converting Rd files to markdown in the Gatsby theme [RocketSeat](https://github.com/rocketseat/gatsby-themes). However, you can opt out of this and use it as Rd converter.

This workflow could not be possible without the [Rd2md](https://github.com/quantsch/Rd2md), [Rd2roxygen](https://github.com/yihui/Rd2roxygen), and [roxygen2md](https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2md) packages.
