**rdConvert** is can be installed from GitHub using the devtools or remotes package.

```r
remotes::install_github("davidruvolo51/rdConvert")
```

## Getting Node and Gatsby Installed

If using the [RocketSeat Gatsby Theme](https://github.com/Rocketseat/gatsby-starter-rocket-docs), you will need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). Follow the installation instructions on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). To confirm the installation, run the following command in the terminal.

```shell
node -v
```

Next, install [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/).

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Create a new RocketSeat project inside the current R project. See the [RocketSeat GitHub readme](https://github.com/Rocketseat/gatsby-starter-rocket-docs) for the latest installation instructions.

```shell
gatsby new rocket-docs https://github.com/rocketseat/gatsby-starter-rocket-docs
```

This will create a new Gatsby project inside the folder `rocket-docs` inside your R project. You can use any name you like.

That's it! You are now ready to build your site.
